# About Section
about:
  intro: |
    **6 years shipping products, 3+ years in strategy & consulting**

    I structure messy problems into products people actually use. Built across retail,
    finance, and manufacturing, leading with real usage and outcomes that prove things
    work. My consulting background means I'm comfortable with complexity: stakeholder
    alignment, ambiguous briefs, data-heavy environments.

    Currently building LLYLI, a language learning app → check the button on the left
    to help me with my research, and completing Carnegie Mellon's PM Program. Based in Lisbon.
